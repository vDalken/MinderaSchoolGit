# Repositorio
 A repository or more commonly known as repo is a tool used by programmers in order to apply changes to a project.
 It's one of the most important tools in any programmers arsenal, as it allows f
or a large team to add changes to a project without compromising the initial fil
e. Since it allows to create multiple points in a project development, any bug b
ug that appears or any mistake a developer makes, that person can easily go back
 to a version where it didn't happen. 
 There's a lot of companies that have cloud repos, making it even a more powerfu
ll instrument, because if anything happens to our machine, our files will be in
the cloud, making it easy to resume the project.
# Branch
 When we talk about branches, we have to know that there's the main one, the start of the project and then, we can
make different versions of the main branch. That allows the developers to write code without affecting the main branch
and creating problems. This way, the project is organized in different versions, versions that we can then merge with
the main branch and make permanent changes.

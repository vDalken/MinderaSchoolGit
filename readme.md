The fact that GitHub's repositories are saved remotely, this means that the code can be access from anywhere with an internet connection by the developer.
This has numerous advantages some of them being: The security of always having the code saved in a cloud, making it unlikely that total data loss happens; the ease of accessibility means it's more versatile than just having the files saved locally; the fact that it's remote also facilitates collaboration between developers, which makes it so that physical access to the machine where the repo is being stored isn't necessary for any sort of changes.
